# Abstract:
 In this report, I explained the problem of Secret Sharing Scheme. Then based on the definition of the problem, two old methods: Blakley’s Secret Sharing Scheme and Shamir’s Secret Sharing are introduced. However, we explained the details of the first one since it’s the topic of this work. Blakley’s method has an application in distributing a key between different parties and reconstructing the key based on each share. However, this method is not efficient enough because of too large space states. Also, we tried to simulate a scenario for spreading a key between some users and tried to reconstruct the first key using Matlab in a graphical user interface.
