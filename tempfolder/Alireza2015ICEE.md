# Abstract:
In this work we developed an on-demand, multiroute power aware routing protocol for mobile ad hoc wireless networks named EMR-AODV. This protocol works based on the well-known AODV algorithm. Unlike AODV, each node uses forward and reverse routing table in EMR-AODV. EMR-AODV infers an appropriate lifetime for each path, based on residual energy and distance between nodes. Afterwards and based on these lifetimes, destination and intermediate nodes will choose the best path for the data packets. Unlike AODV, in this algorithm, reverse and forward paths are not coinciding on each other between a pair of nodes. Each node adjusts its transmission power according to its distance to its next hop. Our simulation using ns-2 shows that EMR-AODV extends the lifetime of the nodes up to 73 percent. EMR-AODV also decreases routing overhead about 40 percent by reducing the number of route discovery steps.
